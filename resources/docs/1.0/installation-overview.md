## Overview

Before you get started please note the following; Logdo is written in php (Laravel), No frontend js is used except for laravel-echo and its not user facing. 
##
That being said, Logdo exposes an API that makes it so easy to create client SDKs for any of your favourite language and framework. See more [here](/{{route}}/{{version}}/apis-and-sdks).
