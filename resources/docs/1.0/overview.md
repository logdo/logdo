## Motivation

It's simple, I just got tired of ssh'ing into different servers to tail the logs. We are sure that you also have some pain point you'd like to address, like, being able to view all incoming requests and their responses or seeing all the quries being written to database. Whatever your pain point is, we guarantee that you are not alone and we welcome come contributions from you!
